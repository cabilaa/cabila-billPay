   <string name="copyright">Bill Pay is an application designed to calculate fixed interest (flat rate).
Fixed interest is a type of loan interest where the monthly amount remains constant and does not change throughout the loan period.\n\n
       Formula Used:\n
       Monthly Interest = Loan × (Interest / 100)\n
        Total Interest = Monthly Interest × Duration\n
        Total Debt = Loan + Total Interest\n\n
